# This section controls how much to increase the probability of equipping tools or armor
# based on the current game difficulty. Values are added to each base probability.
# Example: If diamond_sword has a base probability of 0.005 and difficulty is HARD (1.0),
# the final probability becomes 1.005

  EASY: 0.0       # No bonus applied to probabilities

  HARD: 20.0      # +20% added to each probability (hardest mode = highest gear spawn rate)
